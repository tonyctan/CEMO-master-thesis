}{This multilevel structural equation model predicts youth's financial literacy outcomes using PISA 2018 data, with mediating effects of familiarity with, and confidence in, financial matters at student-level. Statistics are standardised regression coefficients. Dashed lines represent nonsignificant relations at $\alpha=.05$ level. Student-level school climate variables and cognitive outcome are decomposed into the within- and between-components (subscript $_W$ and $_B$ respectively) using the MLC approach. Direct pathways are coloured in red and indirect in blue. Control variables are shaded in grey.\\
