}{School climate variables \texttt{FLSCHOOL}, \texttt{FLFAMILY}, and \texttt{NOBULLY}, as well as cognitive outcome \texttt{FLIT} are decomposed into the within- and between-components (subscript $_W$ and $_B$ respectively) using the multilevel latent covariate (MLC) approach. Direct pathways are coloured in red while indirect in blue. Control variables are shaded in gray.}
