}{Measurement models are coloured in gray. The direct and indirect paths of the structural component are represented in red and blue respectively. All parameters were estimated over ten plausible values and pooled using Rubin's rule. Paths failing to reach $\alpha=0.05$ significance level are represented in dash. Significance stars: $^{\tiny *}p<0.05$, $^{\tiny **}p<0.01$, $^{\tiny ***}p<0.001$. Presentation convention: estimate$^\text{\tiny significance stars}$ (standard error)}
