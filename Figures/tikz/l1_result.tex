}{This structural equation model predicts financial literacy outcomes from student-level school climate variables, with mediating effects of familiarity with, and confidence in, financial matters. Statistics are standardised regression coefficients.  All parameters were estimated over ten plausible values and pooled using Rubin's rule. Paths failing to reach $\alpha=0.05$ significance level are represented in dash. All solid paths carry significance levels with $p<0.001$.}
