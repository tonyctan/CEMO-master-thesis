}{This multilevel structural equation model predicts youth's financial literacy outcomes using PISA 2018 data, with mediating effects of familiarity with, and confidence in, financial matters at student-level (\textcolor{red}{direct} and \textcolor{blue}{indirect} pathways). Statistics are standardised regression coefficients. Dashed lines represent nonsignificant relations at $\alpha=0.05$ level. FKI = financial knowledge indices, FLIT = financial literacy.
