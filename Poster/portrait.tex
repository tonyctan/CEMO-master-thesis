        Repeated economic crises in recent times has exposed the cost of financial \emph{illiteracy}. Redress schemes are more effective if introduced early in life \parencite{lusardi:2014}. PISA has been tracking 15-year-olds' financial literacy levels since 2012 with the latest 2018 results showing sizeable differences across the globe. The aim of this study is to identify school climate variables that covary strongly with youth's financial literacy outcomes for the purpose of lending support to school leaders and policy makers in their evidence-based decision making with research questions:

        \begin{enumerate}
            \item[RQ1:] To what extent can the variation in students' financial literacy outcomes be accounted for by each of the school climate variables?
            \item[RQ2:] In particular, how do cognitive and affective pathways interact during classroom financial literacy interventions?
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Methods}
        PISA 2018 financial literacy data set: 20 participating countries\footnote{Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Estonia, Finland, Georgia, Indonesia, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania,\\the Netherlands, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Russian Federation, Serbia, Slovak Republic, Spain, USA}, 6631 schools, 107162 students

        Missing data: multilevel joint modelling \parencite{asparouhov:2010} with ten sets of imputed data merged with ten plausible values

        Multilevel SEM repeated ten times over each plausible value with results pooled in accordance with \textcite{rubin:1987} using Mplus 8.5

    \textbf{Academic} share \emph{negative} correlation with financial literacy while its effect through affective variables are positive. Effect of \textbf{family} is fully mediated by affective pathways.
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Discussion}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item[RQ1:] All four school climate variables covary significantly with students' financial literacy outcomes
            \item[RQ2:] Classroom activities correlate positively with financial literacy via affective pathways, but negatively via cognitive pathway
        \end{enumerate}

        \textbf{Conclusion}: It is the joint effort from school, family, safety and resources to bring about a future-ready, financially literate generation. \textbf{Take away message}: Youth at 15 reacts best to \emph{affective} approaches to financial education. \textbf{Implications}: Pedagogically, it may not be technical curricula targeting the brain, but empowerment appealing to the heart, that would carry the most promise.
