# CEMO-master-thesis

A repository of my CEMO master thesis

Welcome to my thesis repository. This is a project to fulfil the degree requirement for Master in Educational Assessment, Evaluation, and Measurement at the Centre for Educational Measurement (CEMO), Faculty of Educational Sciences, University of Oslo.

My thesis supervisor is Prof Ronny Scherer, co-supervisor Dr Chia-Wen Chen. I am using 2018 PISA financial literacy data to investigate which school climate variables have the strongest relationship to 15-year-old students' financial literacy outcomes. A multi-level modelling analysis is necessary for this cross-country comparison because students are first of all nested in schools and schools are then nested in countries---violating independent sampling assumption in usual regression modelling.
