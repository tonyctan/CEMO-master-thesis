%Repeated economic crises in recent memory have exposed the harsh consequences of financial \emph{illiteracy} shared by high proportions of the general population. Policy makers experienced little resistance when identifying youth as the most effective group for bringing about improvement in citizens' ability to engage with economic and financial matters, but opinions quickly diverge over the optimal approaches for achieving such targeted outcome. Existing literature frequently reports the importance of family environment in cultivating students' financial literacy through the process of ``financial socialisation'' -- [definition goes here] (reference). Such practice, however, encounters interrogation by educators over equity concerns should families remain the main arena for financial literacy development. Schools play vital roles in alleviating inequality in accessing education and training in general but scarce research so far has been devoted into identifying the specific classroom factors that are most effective in advancing students' financial literacy outcomes. The current study therefore attempts to contribute to this enquiry by investigating the relationship between school climate variables and students' financial literacy achievement with an aim of stimulating policy debate about the levers and instruments available to education interventionists for the purpose of improving young people's financial literacy and preparedness as they step into an increasingly uncertain world. Using the 2018 PISA dataset, this paper employs a three-level hierarchical model to conduct cross-country comparisons to highlight school climate variables that are most strongly associated with high financial literacy outcomes.

A positive and healthy school climate

Using the latest wave of Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2018 financial literacy data

A two-level multilevel structural equation model (MSEM) revealed that 33.5\% of the variation in students' PISA 2018 financial literacy scores could be explained by student-level variables and 47.7\% by school-level factors. The MSEM also highlighted key roles financial knowledge and financial confidence played in mediating students' financial literacy performance. Both school financial education and parental financial socialisation showed positive associations with financial knowledge and confidence but their direct effects on financial literacy scores were shown to be negative after mediation pathways have been accounted for.
