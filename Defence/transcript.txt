The title of my thesis | highlighted the key elements | contained in this research project. At its core, I wish to investigate | the relationships between | school climate | and financial literacy. I used PISA 2018 data and applied a | multilevel structural equation model (MSEM) | in order to answer my research questions.

[Slide 2]

Empowering citizens with financial literacy is vital | for the healthy functioning of a society. It is unreasonable, for instance, to ask people | to vote on issues | that they don't understand. Even worse, should education and reasons | not win over the population, opportunism and populism will. With ageing populations | and rapidly transitioning economies, it is not an option |for educators to leave our youth | to fend for themselves | in this ever challenging world.

[Slide 3]

Fortunately, the past decade has witnessed steady growth | in research interests | over youth's financial literacy. Existing literature, however, appears to focus [either] on individual learners | [or] on school organisations. Such disjoint left out | the important insight | into the [interaction process] linking students | to their school environment.

In addition, multiple papers reported underwhelming results | on the effectiveness | of various school intervention programs. It was not yet clear | whether such mixed results | signalled improvement opportunities | for pedagogy, or they were | methodological artefacts due to, for example, omitted variable problems.

This study was motivated | with the current stock of knowledge in mind, and wished to answer | the following two research questions: 1. To what extent | can the variation | in students' financial literacy outcomes | be accounted for | by school climate variables? and 2. How does the school-level climate | impact on individual learners' financial literacy acquisition process?

[Slide 4]

At a macro-level, this study treated | school climate | as exogenous variables (light grey), and students' learning outcomes | as endogenous variables (dark grey). Among the endogenous variables, current literature | suggested a mediation role | played by knowledge and confidence | in facilitating financial problem-solving behaviours. I therefore proposed | an input-process-output flow between my variables.

This thesis applied | Wang & Degol's conceptualisation | of school climate. These authors consulted | 6 different theories | ranging from attachment theory | to social cognition, before organising | the abstract idea | of school climate | into a 4-domain structure: academic (the teaching and learning aspect of a school), community (in particular, parental involvement), safety (children cannot learn if they do not feel safe), and lastly, institutional environment (such as the lack of educational resources, and class sizes).

[Slide 5]

Financial literacy | has been an optional section of PISA | since 2012. In 2018, 21 countries opted in | but Australia refused to share its data publicly, reducing my dataset to 20 countries. My final dataset contained over 107 thousand students, nested in over 66 hundred schools.

We quickly noticed that | these 20 countries | were over-represented by industrialised economies | while the Global South | was hardly included in this study.

[Slide 6]

This slide summarised | how I operationalised each construct | into its corresponding | exogenous and endogenous variables.

Familiarity with finance-related matters | was the only sum-score item, while the rest underwent IRT scaling | using partial credit models, with good reliabilities | evidenced by acceptable Crobach's alphas.

The PISA organiser | was also careful | in ensuring cross-country invariance | by employing an iterated procedure | until the root mean square deviances | fell below 0.3.

Test booklets | containing actual financial literacy problems | remained confidential for re-use | but the PISA organiser | disclosed sample questions | that were comparable in style and difficulty | to the actual items. 43 questions were rotated across 24 booklets, resulting in 10 plausible values | representing financial literacy.

One example problem looked like this: Students were presented with a financial document, here a bank statement, and were asked about total bank fees. In order to be successful in this task, students must be table to identify relevant financial information | against multiple distractions | then perform simple arithmetic to reach the correct figure.

[Slide 7]

I am now able to present | my multilevel structural equation model.

At student-level, Level 1, I have:
    intercepts, plus
    endogenous variables, plus
    exogenous variables, plus
    error terms.

At school-level, Level-1 intercepts | were further decomposed into:
    their true means, plus
    between-group variables, plus
    white noises.

Level-1 error terms | were assumed to follow | a multivariate normal distribution | with mean zeros | and diagonal-only | variances. The Level-2 error term | was assumed to be normal | with a zero mean | and a finite variance.

A diagrammatic representation | of my MSEM | is shown on the right. Financial education (FLSCHOOL), financial socialisation (FLFAMILY) and safety (NOBULLY) appeared in both levels | as a result of | multilevel latent covariate (MLC) decomposition.

In order to better represent | the mediation pathways, I drew direct paths using red, and indirect paths in blue.

Control variables | such as socio-economic status, immigration history and sex were represented in grey.

[Not on slides]

Using Mplus 8.5, I first of all recovered missing data | using unrestricted variance-covariance joint modelling (JM-AM H1). Ten plausible values were generated using Bayes estimator, and were merged with the 10 financial literacy PVs.

I then used Mplus's | pseudo maximum likelihood estimator (MLR) | for my MSEM modelling | thanks to its robustness against non-normal data.

Can I take this opportunity to thank my supervisors once again for encouraging me to dive deep into the current methodology literature. Without their guidance, I would [not] have learnt | joint modelling or doubly-latent construction.

[Slide 8]

Now to the Mplus output.

We can first of all see | good model fit indices, a very small RMSEA, for example, suggesting my MSEM proposed earlier fit the PISA data well.

Most hypothesised relationships | between variables | were shown to be highly significant, except for the one | between safety and confidence.

In order to enhance the visual effect, I let the thickness of an arrows grow |in proportion to its point estimate. Thicker arrows therefore indicated stronger relationships.

My MSEM also yielded significant contextual effects for | financial education, financial socialisation and safety, suggesting the importance of school environment | in shaping students' financial literacy performance. Effect sizes around 0.35 further indicated that | such contextual effects were meaningful discoveries rather than | mere statistical artefacts.

[Slides 9]

I am now able to answer my research questions:
For the first question of whether school climate variables | strongly covaried | with students' PISA 2018 | financial literacy performance, the answer is yes. All four school climate variables | proposed by Wang & Degol | carried strong statistical significance | for explaining the variation in financial literacy scores.
For the second question concerning the existence of interaction effects between students and schools, the answer is also yes. For financial literacy in particular, schools played meaningful and sizeable roles in influencing students' financial literacy outcomes.

I also wish to report two main limitations to this study:
Since this project employed a correlational research design, one is unable to ascertain the arrow of causality. This inability is particularly acute when interpreting the negative signs between FLSCHOOL and FLIT and FLFAMILY and FLIT.
If one insists on "left causes right", then these negative signs potentially signalled shortcomings in current teaching practices | where problem-solving skills must also be emphasised | in addition to knowledge and confidence.

Should the reverse causality is true, teachers and parents must have been prioritising children who are most at risk of low financial literacy---and the corresponding policy advice | would be to contribute additional resources.

Other possibilities could be: potential confound variable, non-linear relationships and long implementation lags---all could lead to interesting and productive future research projects.

The second limitation arises from my model design | where I pooled 20 countries into a global dataset. The resulting parameters must then | be interpreted as global. After thesis submission, I experimented my MSEM on different countries | and observed clear country differences on the right. While FLSCHOOL was negatively correlated with FLIT in most countries, Finland showed a clear positive relationship between the two variables. Since education decisions are almost invariably made at national levels, policy makers should be aware of the global parameters' limitations.

Having acknowledged these caveats, I believe this thesis still made meaningful contributions to both education theories and methodology. It applied a substantive theoretical framework of school climate to youth's financial literacy development process in order to examine how individuals' capability is formed [in the context of] their school environment. This person-ecological approach reconciled two strands of research efforts that focused either on students or on schools into one unified structure.

In terms of methodology, this study attempted a recent development in the MSEM literature using a multilevel latent covariate approach in order to correct for unreliability when lower-level constructs were aggregated to higher-levels.

A well-functioning society | relies on its citizens' financial literacy for the betterment of their own well-being and that of the collective. Policy-makers, school leaders, teachers and parents all have progressively | come to terms with the cost of neglect | and demanded evidence-based action plans. This thesis answered this call | by exploring four aspects of school climate | using the latest international large-scale assessment data---Education matters. Parenting matters. Safety and resource fundings do matter. These conclusions shed light to the policy priorities | that can be actioned upon without delay. This study served only as a starting point | for a vibrant scholarly conversation about better preparing our young for an ever-challenging future. I wish them well.

Thank you.
