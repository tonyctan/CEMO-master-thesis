\chapter*{Abstract}
\label{Ab.1}

Repeated economic crises in recent memory have exposed the harsh consequences of financial \emph{illiteracy} shared by high proportions of the general population. Policy makers experienced little resistance when identifying youth as the most effective group for bringing about improvement in citizens' ability to engage with economic and financial matters, but opinions quickly diverge over the optimal approaches for achieving such targeted outcome. Existing literature frequently reports the importance of family environment in cultivating students' financial literacy through the process of ``financial socialisation'' -- [definition goes here] (reference). Such practice, however, encounters interrogation by educators over equity concerns should families remain the main arena for financial literacy development. Schools play vital roles in alleviating inequality in accessing education and training in general but scarce research so far has been devoted into identifying the specific classroom factors that are most effective in advancing students' financial literacy outcomes. The current study therefore attempts to contribute to this enquiry by investigating the relationship between school climate variables and students' financial literacy achievement with an aim of stimulating policy debate about the levers and instruments available to education interventionists for the purpose of improving young people's financial literacy and preparedness as they step into an increasingly uncertain world. Using the 2018 PISA dataset, this paper employs a three-level hierarchical model to conduct cross-country comparisons to highlight school climate variables that are most strongly associated with high financial literacy outcomes.

\section{Country-level Financial Knowledge Index}

PISA 2018 financial literacy dataset \parencite{FLdata} provides rich information about students and schools. For the purpose of cross-country comparison, however, the country-level financial literacy information must be addressed separately by the researchers. Earlier attempts such as \textcite{morenoherrero:2018a} approximated this information using a variable ``quality of math and science education'' to control for country-level differences since consensus is yet to emerge about the most appropriate measure for countries' financial knowledge. Inspired by the UN's approach to forming Human Development Indices, a recent publication by \textcite{olivermarquez:2020} proposed a macroeconomic measure for countries' general financial knowledge levels by examining their economic capability, educational training, existing practices in the financial markets as well as incentives to interact with financial products. More specifically, the authors considered a country's economic capability, represented by its GDP per capita, to be a key dimension in bringing about its financial knowledge index (FKI). Secondly, literature converges on the importance of educational training for a country's financial knowledge capability \parencite{oecd:2005}. Thirdly, countries with regular engagement with sophisticated financial products and financial markets should possess higher FKI. Lastly, countries with higher aggregate consumption levels and with ageing populations are likely to possess higher FKI due to more frequent exposure and pressure in retirement provision, respetively. Macroeconomic data needed for these computations can be sourced from the World Bank \parencite{worldbank:data} and the United Nations' \textit{Human Development Reports} \parencite{hdr:data}.

Combining individual and institutional data cources can be a productive approach in international large-scale assessment (ILSA) research. According to the framework for comparative education analyses \parencite{bray:1995}, this project extends education outcome measures to a country level, addresses the aspect of society and labour market, and relates countries' entire populations to ILSA research \parencite{strietholt:2018}. By combining education outcome data with countries' economic performance indicators, this project remains most comparable to \textcite{hanushek:2012a}---while these authors looked into the relationship between countries' education achievement and their GDP growth, the current investigation highlights how countries' GDP, along with other macroeconomic practices, in turn systematically impacts on their youth's educational performance.

\label{chp:3}

\section{Data / Sample / Participants}

This study drew its primary data soruce from PISA 2018 database \parencite{FLdata} containing 107,174 observations spanning 20 countries, in which students were asked about their demographic background, family lives and school experiences. For the financial literacy section, in particular, students responded to qustions about their confidence about financial matters, familiarity with concepts of finance, their parental involvement in matters of fianncial literacy. Ten plausible values were subsequently generated by PISA organisers as measures of students' financial literacy outcomes and were used as the dependent variable.

Student-level independent variables are

School-level independent variables are

Country-level independent variables are

Missing data are handled using Mplus's multiple imputation procedure with ten imputations generated and pooled subsequently following Rubin's Rule (Rubin, 1976).

A three-level multigroup structural equation model was employed to account for the hiearchical structure of the PISA design, with private versus public school as the grouping variable.

\section{Country-level Financial Knowledge Index}

This project closely follows \poscite{olivermarquez:2020} procedure in developing country-level financial kowledge indices using four sub-indices: economic capability (\texttt{EC}), educational training (\texttt{ET}), existing practices in financial market (\texttt{Use}), and incentives (\texttt{Need}) to engage with financial products. The first sub-index \texttt{EC} is calculated using the logarithm of a country's GDP per capita in current international dollars (purchasing power parity adjusted). For the \texttt{ET} sub-index, a country's highly skilled workforce is represented by its postgraduate to total tertiary graduation ratio, and the mean years of schooling is used to measure its general education level. For the \texttt{Use} sub-index, gross portfolio equity assets (GPEA) and insurance company assets (ICA) are considered sophisticated financial products a country engages in. Additionally, in order to capture the central role of technology in amplifying the proliferation and use of financial assets, the proportion of a country's Internet users (\textsc{IUS}) enters the definition via
\[ \texttt{Use} = ( \text{GPEA} + \text{ICA} ) ^ \text{IUS}. \]
The final sub-index \texttt{Need} is compiled as
\[ \texttt{Need} = ( \text{PFA} + \text{AC} ) ^ \text{AGEING}, \]
where \textsc{PFA} is the pension fund assets to GDP ratio. Aggregate consumption is defined as:
\[ \text{AC} = \frac{2\% \times \text{household final consumption expenditure}}{\text{GDP}}, \]
with the ``$2\%$ rule'' being drawn from \poscite{caliendo:2013} derivation, and the proportion of ageing population is computed as
\[ \text{AGEING} = \frac{ \left[ \frac{\text{population}(>65)}{\text{population}(20 \sim 64)} \right]_{2018} - \left[ \frac{\text{population}(>65)}{\text{population}(20 \sim 64)} \right]_{2009} }{ \left[ \frac{\text{population}(>65)}{\text{population}(20 \sim 64)} \right]_{2009} }. \]

\subsection{Data Collection and Missing Data Treatment}

The data sources for FKI computation are documented in \cref{tab:FKIsource} and its associated notes. Sub-indices \texttt{ET} and \texttt{Use} both contain missing observations for the year 2018. Majority of such missing data appear to be the result of administrative delay, with historic observations available until 2017. It is therefore feasible to conduct time-series forecasts using prior year observations to best approximate 2018 values.

\input{./Tables/FKIsource}

\subsubsection{Sub-index \texttt{ET}}

The 2018 archive for the number of master (ISCED 7), PhD (ISCED 8), and total tertiary graduates are incomplete for all participating countries except Georgia, Indonesia and Serbia. \cref{fig:skilled} presents a time series plot of

\[ \text{SKILLED} = \frac{\text{number of masters} + \text{number of PhDs}}{\text{total number of tertiary graduates}} \]

\pfigure{fig:skilled}{Proportion of Postgraduates to Total Tertiary Graduations}{1}{./Figures/skilled.pdf}{``Postgraduate'' is defined as master (ISCED 7) and PhD (ISCED 8) graduates. Countries not shown: GEO, IDN and SRB (2018 data available) and RUS (consult other sources)}{1.75}{1.25}
%
and suggests that this ratio is likely to be stable over time, especially between adjacent years. A ``naive forecast'', where the nearest available year's data are to be duplicated for 2018, is applied for SKILLED.

\subsubsection{Sub-index \texttt{Use}}

All series involved in calculating this sub-index, GPEA, ICA and IUS, contain missing data. When time series data contain only exponential growth but no underlying trend, a simple exponential smoothing would suffice \parencite{garder:1985}; if trend is present, Holt-Winters method is superior \parencite{chatfield:1978}. \cref{fig:use} facilitates this decision making by plotting both the original and log-transformed versions of GPEA and ICA series. Since curves after log-transformations have slopes, it is prudent to apply the Holt-Winters forecasting method in order to account for possible trends contained in the original series.

\pfigure{fig:use}{Time Series Trend Test}{1}{./Figures/use.pdf}{The time series plots after natural logarithm transformations (bottom panels) are not flat, suggesting the original series (top panels) contain trends. Holt-Winters method therefore is preferred over simple exponential smoothing for 2018 forecasts.}{0.5}{0.85}

The IUS series contains missing data for Canada, Chile and the United States. Similar Holt-Winters procedure is applied to recover 2018 IUS data.

\input{./Tables/FKIraw}

\subsubsection{Other Items with Data Concerns}

Russia reported 67.96\% and 61.01\% of its total university degree receipients to be postgraduates for the year 2013 and 2015 respectively (2014 missing). This figure rapidly declines to 41.6\% in 2016 and further down to 25.69\% in 2017. Such volatility goes against the stable patterns shared by most countries in \cref{fig:skilled}, casting doubt on data reliability. Separate investigation is therefore conducted using Russian government archive (Notes c to g in \cref{tab:FKIsource}).

Georgia underwent pension reform in 2018 with fund balance gradually transitioning to State Pension Agency for its official resumption of duty on 1 January 2019. Resultantly, 2018 pension balance for this country is unavailable but to be best appoximated using 2019 official data (Notes h, i and * of \cref{tab:FKIsource}).

\cref{tab:FKIraw} documents the results of the abovementioned data recovery process.

\subsection{Standardisation, Weights and FKI}

Following \textcite{olivermarquez:2020}'s procedure, all series in \cref{tab:FKIraw} undergo min-max normalisation such that the smallest entry receives a new score of $0.01$ and the biggest number is re-coded to $0.99$. This slight deviation from the original paper (where the min-max normalisation yields $0$ to $1$) is to avoid multiplying a series by zero or raising a base to the power of zero.

Variable weights are calculated following \textcite{olivermarquez:2020}'s recipe to be the inverses of each series' standard deviations. Whereas a sub-index combines more than one series, each weight is further divided by the sum of the constituent weights so that total weights add to one.

FKI is finally computed by taking the geometric mean of all four sub-indices, subject to sub-index-weights similar to variable weights above, as presented in \cref{tab:FKI}.
