\label{Ab.0}

Preparing youth for life-long success with numeracy, literacy and science capability has been the foundation for all schooling. The post-global financial crises and post-COVID era, in addition, imposes increasing demand on financial literacy for school leavers. Since 2012, OECD has been a pioneer in measuring 15-year-olds' financial literacy through its triennial Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) cycles. Subsequent analyses using PISA data, however, reported paradoxical results that more classroom interventions tend to be associated with either no differences or even lower scores in students' financial literacy measures. It is in educators' interest therefore to carefully examine the relationship between school climate variables, including the academic, safety, community and institutional envrionment aspects of students' lives, and their financial literacy outcomes.

[Project summary]

The motivation for this project originates from my confusion over the current stock of literature, which states that school efforts do not matter, even harmful, in bringing about students' financial literacy while homes are better suited for this purpose. This claim is worrisome because if school are committing something wrong, school leaders and policy makers genuently want to know what, which and where so that harmful pedagogies can be reverted into good practices. Alternatively, it could also be the measurement instrument researchers employed so far that led to such underwhelming results. A closer examination of how school effectiveness is measured would also promote research practice and the resultant policy advice.

Using 2018 PISA financial literacy data, including all 20 participating countries, I was able to examine how school climate variables, namely ACADEMIC, SAFETY, COMMUNITY and INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT each explained the total variation in students' financial literacy outcomes. Using a multilevel SEM with students' finance-related affective variables as mediators, my random intercept model shows that schools' academic practices do matter in advancing students' financial literacy outcomes but only through affective pathways. Cognitive pathways, however, were shown to correlate negatively with financial literacy scores. Since schools' congnitive and affective pathways are similar in size but opposite in signs, combining the two into total effects would have inadvertently resulted in the nonfindings as reported by prior literature. In addition to this methodological insight, countries that overly focused on accountability through standard testing, tracking and measuring students' financial skills (e.g., the USA) fell prey to this cognitive trap while countries that placed more emphases on cultivating students' affective affinity such as confidence in, and familiarity with, financial matters (e.g., Finland) delivered impressive education outcome in financial literacy.

\chapter*{Abstract}
\label{Ab.1}

Repeated economic crises in recent memory have exposed the harsh consequences of financial \emph{illiteracy} shared by high proportions of the general population. Policy makers experienced little resistance when identifying youth as the most effective group for bringing about improvement in citizens' ability to engage with economic and financial matters, but opinions quickly diverge over the optimal approaches for achieving such targeted outcome. Existing literature frequently reports the importance of family environment in cultivating students' financial literacy through the process of ``financial socialisation'' -- [definition goes here] (reference). Such practice, however, encounters interrogation by educators over equity concerns should families remain the main arena for financial literacy development. Schools play vital roles in alleviating inequality in accessing education and training in general but scarce research so far has been devoted into identifying the specific classroom factors that are most effective in advancing students' financial literacy outcomes. The current study therefore attempts to contribute to this enquiry by investigating the relationship between school climate variables and students' financial literacy achievement with an aim of stimulating policy debate about the levers and instruments available to education interventionists for the purpose of improving young people's financial literacy and preparedness as they step into an increasingly uncertain world. Using the 2018 PISA dataset, this paper employs a three-level hierarchical model to conduct cross-country comparisons to highlight school climate variables that are most strongly associated with high financial literacy outcomes.

%//mark Broad motivation

Repeated economic crises in recent memory have exposed the harsh consequences of financial \emph{illiteracy} shared by high proportions of the general population. Low levels of financial literacy are observed not only in less developed countries such as India and Indonesia \parencite{cole:2009} but also in advanced economies such as the USA \parencite{huston:2012}, Germany \parencite{bucherkoenen:2016} and OECD countries \parencite{lusardi:2015a}. Amongst the many redress schemes aimed at promoting citizens' financial capability, the return on investment is the highest when intervention is applied early in life. \textcite{lusardi:2014} have shown that providing financial knowledge to the least educated before they enter the labour market increases their well-being by approximately 82\% of their initial wealth, while the rate of return is around 56\% for college graduates---results that are significant both statistically and economically.

Research efforts aiming at advancing youth's financial literacy over the years evolved into two strands: on the design and evaluation of school financial education programs, and on the influence of home environment through the process of financial socialisation---the intentional or involuntary transmission of financial concepts which are required to functioning successfully in society \parencite{bowen:2002}. A recent meta-analysis conducted by \textcite{kaiser:2020} found that while school financial education programs had sizeable impacts on \emph{financial knowledge} ($+0.33\ SD$) similar to education interventions in other domains, their effect on students' \emph{financial behaviour} is quite small ($+0.07\ SD$). This conclusion added to a list of weak or non-findings regarding the long-term behavioural effect brought about by school financial education programs. \textcite{brown:2016}, for instance, reported mixed outcome in students' long-term financial well-being depending on the programs received; whereas \textcite{cole:2016} observed that traditional personal finance courses lacked any explanatory power in accounting for graduates' financial outcome once the additional mathematics training in which finance topics were packaged has been controlled for. Despite careful controls and thoughtful study designs, correlating classroom interventions and young people's financial literacy outcomes has repeatedly yielded paradoxical results of non-significant or even negative relationship; any positive findings remain small in magnitudes and/or are sensitive to robust analyses.

Optimism, fortunately, runs higher at the financial socialisation camp. Building on the acknowledgement that families serve as information filters from the outside world \parencite{danes:2007} as well as the foundation for youth's continued financial concept formation, \textcite{gudmunson:2011} put forward a family financial socialisation theory to accommodate both the \emph{process} and the \emph{outcome} for variations in young people's financial capabilities. Using structural equation modelling, \textcite{jorgensen:2010} was able to show that perceived parental influence had a direct and moderately significant influence on financial attitude, did \emph{not} have an effect on \emph{financial knowledge}, and had an indirect and moderately significant influence on financial behaviour, mediated through financial attitude. This attitude(A)--behaviour(B)
--cognition(C) conceptualisation of financial literacy \parencite{potrich:2015} continues to influence subsequent research effort. More recently, \textcite{morenoherrero:2018a} continued this line of enquiry by applying multilevel regression analyses to 2015 PISA data and reported that students' financial literacy was associated mainly with understanding the value of saving and discussing money matters with parents. In addition, exposure and use of financial products, in particular holding a bank account, improved students' financial knowledge as well.

One chief concern for every research project is the quality of its data source. Amongst competing inventories, PISA stands out as a comprehensive and reliable source of data for measuring 15-year-olds' financial literacy outcomes thanks to OECD's careful sampling procedure and attention to construct validity of measurement. Following statistical theory, PISA designers firstly recognise the hierarchical nature of education research data such that students are nested in schools, and schools are further nested in countries. In addition, one student weight is assigned to each observation in order to account for the fact that not all schools in a country are equally likely to be sampled by the PISA organiser; and given a particular school that has been chosen, not every student in this school is equally likely to be asked to participate in the test \parencite{rust:2014}. A third complication arises from the ``planned missingness'' in students' responses because each participant is only given a small number of questions relative to the entire test bank in order to ensure their responses are not undermined by tiredness \parencite{vondavier:2014}, leading to the outcome variables being represented by ten plausible values. Lastly, PISA consulted and synthesised multiple schools of thoughts \parencite{PISAframework} before constructing financial literacy as \blockquote{the knowledge and understanding of financial concepts and risks, and the skills, motivation and confidence to apply such knowledge and understanding in order to make effective decisions across a range of financial contexts, to improve the financial well-being of individuals and society, and to enable participation in economic life. (p. 128)} As a result, 2018 PISA data set \parencite{FLdata} provides not only variables measuring \emph{cognitive} outcomes but also \emph{affective} factors such as familiarity with concepts of finance and confidence about financial matters, enabling a nuanced study design involving decomposing the total effect of financial literacy development into its ``brain'' (cognitive) and ``heart'' (affective) pathways.

% APA7 Rule 6.50 Lettered Lists and 6.51 Numbered Lists
The current study wishes to take advantage of the latest wave of 2018 PISA results and investigate the covariation financial literacy outcomes share with the following four aspects of young people's daily lives, inspired by school climate literature \parencite{wang:2016}:
\begin{enumerate*}[label={(\alph*)}]
    \item academic training, including any financial education programs received at schools;
    \item safety perception about their schools;
    \item financial socialisation experienced at home; and
    \item their schools' resource endowment.
\end{enumerate*}
More specifically, this project aims to answer these three research questions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[RQ1.] Having controlled for demographic characteristics such as socio-economic status, sex and immmigration history, to what extent can the variation in students' financial literacy outcomes be accounted for by each of the school climate variables mentioned above.
    \item[RQ2.] How does the total effect each school climate variable carries decompose into cognitive and affect pathways.
    \item[RQ3.] How do these effects differ across countries.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Country-level Financial Knowledge Index}

PISA 2018 financial literacy dataset \parencite{FLdata} provides rich information about students and schools. For the purpose of cross-country comparison, however, the country-level financial literacy information must be addressed separately by the researchers. Earlier attempts such as \textcite{morenoherrero:2018a} approximated this information using a variable ``quality of math and science education'' to control for country-level differences since consensus is yet to emerge about the most appropriate measure for countries' financial knowledge. Inspired by the UN's approach to forming Human Development Indices, a recent publication by \textcite{olivermarquez:2020} proposed a macroeconomic measure for countries' general financial knowledge levels by examining their economic capability, educational training, existing practices in the financial markets as well as incentives to interact with financial products. More specifically, the authors considered a country's economic capability, represented by its GDP per capita, to be a key dimension in bringing about its financial knowledge index (FKI). Secondly, literature converges on the importance of educational training for a country's financial knowledge capability \parencite{oecd:2005}. Thirdly, countries with regular engagement with sophisticated financial products and financial markets should possess higher FKI. Lastly, countries with higher aggregate consumption levels and with ageing populations are likely to possess higher FKI due to more frequent exposure and pressure in retirement provision, respetively. Macroeconomic data needed for these computations can be sourced from the World Bank \parencite{worldbank:data} and the United Nations' \textit{Human Development Reports} \parencite{hdr:data}.

Combining individual and institutional data cources can be a productive approach in international large-scale assessment (ILSA) research. According to the framework for comparative education analyses \parencite{bray:1995}, this project extends education outcome measures to a country level, addresses the aspect of society and labour market, and relates countries' entire populations to ILSA research \parencite{strietholt:2018}. By combining education outcome data with countries' economic performance indicators, this project remains most comparable to \textcite{hanushek:2012a}---while these authors looked into the relationship between countries' education achievement and their GDP growth, the current investigation highlights how countries' GDP, along with other macroeconomic practices, in turn systematically impacts on their youth's educational performance.

\section{Data / Sample / Participants}

This study drew its primary data soruce from PISA 2018 database \parencite{FLdata} containing 107,174 observations spanning 20 countries, in which students were asked about their demographic background, family lives and school experiences. For the financial literacy section, in particular, students responded to qustions about their familiarity with concepts of finance (\texttt{FCFMLRTY}), confidence about financial matters (\texttt{FLCONFIN}), their classroom (\texttt{FLSCHOOL}) as well as parental (\texttt{FLFAMILY}) involvement in matters of fianncial literacy. Ten plausible values were subsequently generated by PISA organisers as measures of students' financial literacy outcomes and were used as the dependent variable (\texttt{FLIT}).

Student-level independent variables are

School-level independent variables are

Country-level independent variables are

Missing data are handled using Mplus's multiple imputation procedure with ten imputations generated and pooled subsequently following Rubin's Rule (Rubin, 1976).

A three-level multigroup structural equation model was employed to account for the hiearchical structure of the PISA design, with private versus public school as the grouping variable.

\section{Country-level Financial Knowledge Index}

This project closely follows \poscite{olivermarquez:2020} procedure in developing country-level financial kowledge indices using four sub-indices: economic capability (\texttt{EC}), educational training (\texttt{ET}), existing practices in financial market (\texttt{Use}), and incentives (\texttt{Need}) to engage with financial products. The first sub-index \texttt{EC} is calculated using the logarithm of a country's GDP per capita in current international dollars (purchasing power parity adjusted). For the \texttt{ET} sub-index, a country's highly skilled workforce is represented by its postgraduate to total tertiary graduation ratio, and the mean years of schooling is used to measure its general education level. For the \texttt{Use} sub-index, gross portfolio equity assets (GPEA) and insurance company assets (ICA) are considered sophisticated financial products a country engages in. Additionally, in order to capture the central role of technology in amplifying the proliferation and use of financial assets, the proportion of a country's Internet users (\textsc{IUS}) enters the definition via
\[ \texttt{Use} = ( \text{GPEA} + \text{ICA} ) ^ \text{IUS}. \]
The final sub-index \texttt{Need} is compiled as
\[ \texttt{Need} = ( \text{PFA} + \text{AC} ) ^ \text{AGEING}, \]
where \textsc{PFA} is the pension fund assets to GDP ratio. Aggregate consumption is defined as:
\[ \text{AC} = \frac{2\% \times \text{household final consumption expenditure}}{\text{GDP}}, \]
with the ``$2\%$ rule'' being drawn from \poscite{caliendo:2013} derivation, and the proportion of ageing population is computed as
\[ \text{AGEING} = \frac{ \left[ \frac{\text{population}(>65)}{\text{population}(20 \sim 64)} \right]_{2018} - \left[ \frac{\text{population}(>65)}{\text{population}(20 \sim 64)} \right]_{2009} }{ \left[ \frac{\text{population}(>65)}{\text{population}(20 \sim 64)} \right]_{2009} }. \]

\subsection{Data Collection and Missing Data Treatment}

The data sources for FKI computation are documented in \cref{tab:FKIsource} and its associated notes. Sub-indices \texttt{ET} and \texttt{Use} both contain missing observations for the year 2018. Majority of such missing data appear to be the result of administrative delay, with historic observations available until 2017. It is therefore feasible to conduct time-series forecasts using prior year observations to best approximate 2018 values.

\input{./Tables/FKIsource}

\subsubsection{Sub-index \texttt{ET}}

The 2018 archive for the number of master (ISCED 7), PhD (ISCED 8), and total tertiary graduates are incomplete for all participating countries except Georgia, Indonesia and Serbia. \cref{fig:skilled} presents a time series plot of

\[ \text{SKILLED} = \frac{\text{number of masters} + \text{number of PhDs}}{\text{total number of tertiary graduates}} \]

\pfigure{fig:skilled}{Proportion of Postgraduates to Total Tertiary Graduations}{1}{./Figures/skilled.pdf}{``Postgraduate'' is defined as master (ISCED 7) and PhD (ISCED 8) graduates. Countries not shown: GEO, IDN and SRB (2018 data available) and RUS (consult other sources)}{1.75}{1.25}
%
and suggests that this ratio is likely to be stable over time, especially between adjacent years. A ``naive forecast'', where the nearest available year's data are to be duplicated for 2018, is applied for SKILLED.

\subsubsection{Sub-index \texttt{Use}}

All series involved in calculating this sub-index, GPEA, ICA and IUS, contain missing data. When time series data contain only exponential growth but no underlying trend, a simple exponential smoothing would suffice \parencite{garder:1985}; if trend is present, Holt-Winters method is superior \parencite{chatfield:1978}. \cref{fig:use} facilitates this decision making by plotting both the original and log-transformed versions of GPEA and ICA series. Since curves after log-transformations have slopes, it is prudent to apply the Holt-Winters forecasting method in order to account for possible trends contained in the original series.

\pfigure{fig:use}{Time Series Trend Test}{1}{./Figures/use.pdf}{The time series plots after natural logarithm transformations (bottom panels) are not flat, suggesting the original series (top panels) contain trends. Holt-Winters method therefore is preferred over simple exponential smoothing for 2018 forecasts.}{0.5}{0.85}

The IUS series contains missing data for Canada, Chile and the United States. Similar Holt-Winters procedure is applied to recover 2018 IUS data.

\input{./Tables/FKIraw}

\subsubsection{Other Items with Data Concerns}

Russia reported 67.96\% and 61.01\% of its total university degree receipients to be postgraduates for the year 2013 and 2015 respectively (2014 missing). This figure rapidly declines to 41.6\% in 2016 and further down to 25.69\% in 2017. Such volatility goes against the stable patterns shared by most countries in \cref{fig:skilled}, casting doubt on data reliability. Separate investigation is therefore conducted using Russian government archive (Notes c to g in \cref{tab:FKIsource}).

Georgia underwent pension reform in 2018 with fund balance gradually transitioning to State Pension Agency for its official resumption of duty on 1 January 2019. Resultantly, 2018 pension balance for this country is unavailable but to be best appoximated using 2019 official data (Notes h, i and * of \cref{tab:FKIsource}).

\cref{tab:FKIraw} documents the results of the abovementioned data recovery process.

\subsection{Standardisation, Weights and FKI}

Following \textcite{olivermarquez:2020}'s procedure, all series in \cref{tab:FKIraw} undergo min-max normalisation such that the smallest entry receives a new score of $0.01$ and the biggest number is re-coded to $0.99$. This slight deviation from the original paper (where the min-max normalisation yields $0$ to $1$) is to avoid multiplying a series by zero or raising a base to the power of zero.

Variable weights are calculated following \textcite{olivermarquez:2020}'s recipe to be the inverses of each series' standard deviations. Whereas a sub-index combines more than one series, each weight is further divided by the sum of the constituent weights so that total weights add to one.

FKI is finally computed by taking the geometric mean of all four sub-indices, subject to sub-index-weights similar to variable weights above, as presented in \cref{tab:FKI}.

%//tip Quickly re-word my research questions. Not to answer them right now but to remind the readers "why we are here". In order to answer these questions, let's first of all examine the descriptive statistics, the correlationss, by country and by levels, blah blah. Most importantly, I would like to interrogate the measurement part because its robustness directly determine the validity of my models.
